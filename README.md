# Open Analytics Resources

Originally a Google document is supported by the Association of Professional 
Healthcare Analysts (AphA), This Equals and Keyah Consulting, in collaboration 
with the Health Foundation, released under a CC-BY-SA licence. 
Attributions to AphA 2020. 
Later this was copied by ZoÃ« Turner into {bookdown} and now has been converted 
into a Quarto book to be shared through the NHS-R Community. 
This document is still active.

This document is a resource for analysts and data scientists working in the 
health and care sectors primarily, but not exclusively, in the UK.
