## Small number suppression

[Public Health Wales](https://phw.nhs.wales/about-us/policies-and-procedures/policies-and-procedures-documents/information-governance-information-management-and-technology-supporting-documents/small-numbers-publishing-guidance/) guidance in the Appendices is very useful in that it gives example situations for data suppression and how to handle them, including small denominator values, indirect disclosure and where self disclosure can cause distress.

[UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/data-protection/disclosure-assessment/) assessing disclosure risk and managing risk has an example from a review showing the types of direct identifiers as well as variables affected by local knowledge.

[Health Economics Unit NHS Guide](https://healtheconomicsunit.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-linkage-guide_January-2022.pdf) - "This guide to data linkage was produced to support NHS systems (such as ICSs and STPs), commissioners, providers, NHS England and NHS Improvement and armâ€™s-length bodies to co-learn and co-develop, and to share and spread best practice, learning and tools relating to data linkage that extends beyond primary and secondary care".
