Bristol, N Somerset and S Gloucestershire CCG Analytics: PathSimR This project aimed to improve understanding of how care pathways are performing and enable ‘what if’ analysis to identify more effective and efficient service configurations. A versatile pathway tool was developed allows NHS analysts and managers to understand and model patient flow. PathSimR has supported many projects &amp; business cases within the CCG &amp; further afield. As well as improving the evidence base for decision making, the tool opened the eyes of clinicians &amp; managers to the benefits of advanced analytics.

This project aimed to improve the way in which interactive data visualisation is used by clinicians so that it can lead to improvements in quality of care. It is not always clear how useful data visualisation tools are to clinicians or whether they can in fact lead to actionable outcomes. This project by NEQOS explored clinician requirements for engaging with these tools and explored whether more bespoke DV or other data interfaces may be more in line with clinician requirements. A literature review was conducted and an options appraisal undertaken before producing four interactive data visualisation dashboards: hip, knee, maternity and mortality monitoring. These were produced following extensive interaction with clinicians to establish their requirements as the end users. NEQOS have shared all outputs and made them available hereincluding a webinar, slideset and standard operating procedures. These design principles for data visualisation in a healthcare setting were also described in a publication here.

It aimed to improve understanding of the variation in routes-to-diagnosis (for example screen-detected, GP referral, emergency presentation) of cancer in Northern Ireland, in order to increase earlier diagnoses and treatment effectiveness.
