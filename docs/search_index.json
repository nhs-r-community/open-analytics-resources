This project aimed to improve the way in which interactive data visualisation is used by clinicians so that it can lead to improvements in quality of care. It is not always clear how useful data visualisation tools are to clinicians or whether they can in fact lead to actionable outcomes. This project by NEQOS explored clinician requirements for engaging with these tools and explored whether more bespoke DV or other data interfaces may be more in line with clinician requirements. A literature review was conducted and an options appraisal undertaken before producing four interactive data visualisation dashboards: hip, knee, maternity and mortality monitoring. These were produced following extensive interaction with clinicians to establish their requirements as the end users. NEQOS have shared all outputs and made them available hereincluding a webinar, slideset and standard operating procedures. These design principles for data visualisation in a healthcare setting were also described in a publication here.

It aimed to improve understanding of the variation in routes-to-diagnosis (for example screen-detected, GP referral, emergency presentation) of cancer in Northern Ireland, in order to increase earlier diagnoses and treatment effectiveness. It produced estimates for routes-to-diagnosis at different health geographies down to GP practice level, and created an online tool for health service practitioners, informing national cancer strategy.
