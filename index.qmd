Later this was copied by ZoÃ« Turner into {bookdown} and now has been converted into a Quarto book to be shared through the NHS-R Community.
This document is still active.

This document is a resource for analysts and data scientists working in the health and care sectors primarily, but not exclusively, in the UK and includes many links to resources produced and maintained by Public Sector and Government teams.
