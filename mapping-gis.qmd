## Centroid mapping

Sometimes you have a set of addresses but no way of mapping them. [The Office for National Statisticsâ€™ Open Geography Portal](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons-postcode-directory-latest-centroids) provides the centroids for all UK postcodes.

Using R to get centroid information: https://www.trafforddatalab.io/recipes/gis/postcodes.html#

Or weighted by LSOA area: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-population-weighted-centroids
